## Development
First, install Go at `https://golang.org/doc/install`. This process depends on your operating system

I strongly recommend VSCode for writing Go. It is a free IDE from Microsoft. After installing VSCode, you should install the Go extension using the four squares in the left riboon for better integration.

Before continuing, run the commands `go version` and `go env` to confirm the installation.

Once Go is installed, clone this repository. 

How is the project structured? We are using Go modules. All the project dependencies are stored in the `go.mod` file. Use the command `go mod download` to automatically download and install the dependencies. You should do this before writing any code.

How to run the code: Using the terminal at the bottom of VSCode, you can do `go run github.com/onlinebooks-418teapot` to start the application.
