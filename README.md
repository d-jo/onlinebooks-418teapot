## Development
First, install Go. This process depends on your operating system and I dont have any details on how to do it on windows. Find a tutorial online.

I strongly reccomend VSCode for writing Go. After installing VSCode, you should install the Go extension for better integration.

How to run the code: Using the terminal at the bottom, you can do `go run github.com/onlinebooks-418teapot`
